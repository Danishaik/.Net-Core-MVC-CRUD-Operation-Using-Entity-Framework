# .Net-Core-MVC-CRUD-Operation-Using-Entity-Framework
This project is an ASP.NET MVC application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
operations on data using Entity Framework (EF). EF is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables you to work with data using .NET classes
without writing much SQL code. This project uses a database-first approach to create the models based on an existing database.
The project also uses scaffolding to generate the controllers and views that interact with the models.
The controllers contain the logic to handle the requests from the views and call the EF methods to manipulate the data.
The views contain the HTML and Razor code that display the data and provide forms for user input.
